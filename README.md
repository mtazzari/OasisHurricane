A Python command-line utility for Linux that computes the economic loss for hurricanes in Florida and in the Gulf states.

positional arguments:
  florida_landfall_rate
                        [float] annual rate of landfalling hurricanes in Florida.
  florida_mean          [float] mean of the economic loss of landfalling hurricane in Florida.
  florida_stddev        [float] std deviation of the economic loss of landfalling hurricane in Florida.
  gulf_landfall_rate    [float] annual rate of landfalling hurricanes in Gulf states.
  gulf_mean             [float] mean of the economic loss of landfalling hurricane in Gulf states.
  gulf_stddev           [float] std deviation of the economic loss of landfalling hurricane in Gulf states.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n NUM_MONTE_CARLO_SAMPLES, --num_monte_carlo_samples NUM_MONTE_CARLO_SAMPLES
                        [int] number of monte carlo samples, i.e. years. (default=10)
  -s SIMULATOR_ID, --simulator SIMULATOR_ID
                        [int] simulator id (default=0). Implemented simulators: (id:name)
                        0: python
                        1: jit
                        2: jit-parallel
                        3: jit-noloops
                        4: python-noloops
  -t, --timeit          If provided, it records the timings of the MC simulation.
                        If TIMEIT_LOGFILE is defined in the shell, it prints the timings to file, else to stdout.
```
The positional parameters are required for execution. 

The utility has **5 different implementations** of the proposed Monte Carlo hurricane losses model, which can be selected 
with the `-s` or `--simulator` option by providing the `id` of the simulator. The implementations achieve different levels
of acceleration w.r.t. the baseline pure-`python` implementation.

The implementations are:

| ID  | Simulator          | Description |
| --- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| 0   | `python`           | a pure Python implementation of the algorithm outlined in the test sheet. Used as a reference for accuracy and performance benchmarks.       |
| 1   | `jit`              | the same algorithm as in `python`, with `numba` just-in-time compilation   |
| 2   | `jit-parallel`     | the same algorithm as in `python`, with `numba` just-in-time compilation **and** `numba` automatic         |
| 3   | `jit-noloops`      | a `numpy`-only algorithm with **no explicit loops**, with `numba` just-in-time compilation   |
| 4   | `python-noloops`   | a pure Python`numpy`-only algorithm with **no explicit loops**          |

## Examples
Let us run a series of examples in which the losses are highly peaked around the
mean loss values. Since the expected mean loss value is 
```bash
florida_landfall_rate * florida_mean + gulf_landfall_rate * gulf_mean
```
it's easy to verify whether the result is about correct.

### Example 1: get started with `gethurricaneloss`
`gethurricaneloss` is easy to use. 

Let us run it with 100k Monte Carlo steps (i.e., years):
```bash
$ gethurricaneloss 10 5 0.00001 30 1 0.00001 -n 100000
[2021-11-04 16:33:01] gethurricaneloss v0.0.1 by Marco Tazzari
[2021-11-04 16:33:01] Validated parameters:
[2021-11-04 16:33:01]          florida_landfall_rate =   10.00000
[2021-11-04 16:33:01]                   florida_mean =    1.60944
[2021-11-04 16:33:01]                 florida_stddev =    0.00001
[2021-11-04 16:33:01]             gulf_landfall_rate =   30.00000
[2021-11-04 16:33:01]                      gulf_mean =    0.00000
[2021-11-04 16:33:01]                    gulf_stddev =    0.00001
[2021-11-04 16:33:01] Using simulator: python
[2021-11-04 16:33:01] Setting the random number generator with seed:None
[2021-11-04 16:33:01] Starting main loop over desired 100000 Monte Carlo samples
[2021-11-04 16:33:12] End of main loop. Elapsed time: 0:00:11.463529 (h:m:s)
[2021-11-04 16:33:12] MEAN LOSS: 79.96644884090169
```
By default, `gethurricaneloss` uses the `python` simulator.

> **Note:**  the `validated parameters` printed in the console/log show the values of the parameters after validation (type- and value-checking), and transformation, if necessary.

> **Note:**  `florida_mean` and `gulf_mean` printed in the console/log are the natural log of the values 
passed in input by the user: the transformation ensures that the expected value of the lognormal distribution
is the value of `florida_mean` passed by the user (as opposed to `exp^florida_mean`). The same applies to `gulf_mean`.

### Example 2: run `gethurricaneloss` with different simulators
Let us now run `gethurricaneloss` using the `python-noloops` simulator (id: 4) by passing the `-s4` option.
```bash
$ gethurricaneloss 10 5 0.00001 30 1 0.00001 -n 100000 -s4
[2021-11-04 16:44:03] gethurricaneloss v0.0.1 by Marco Tazzari
[2021-11-04 16:44:03] Validated parameters:
[2021-11-04 16:44:03]          florida_landfall_rate =   10.00000
[2021-11-04 16:44:03]                   florida_mean =    1.60944
[2021-11-04 16:44:03]                 florida_stddev =    0.00001
[2021-11-04 16:44:03]             gulf_landfall_rate =   30.00000
[2021-11-04 16:44:03]                      gulf_mean =    0.00000
[2021-11-04 16:44:03]                    gulf_stddev =    0.00001
[2021-11-04 16:44:03] Using simulator: python-noloops
[2021-11-04 16:44:03] Setting the random number generator with seed:None
[2021-11-04 16:44:03] Starting main loop over desired 100000 Monte Carlo samples
[2021-11-04 16:44:03] End of main loop. Elapsed time: 0:00:00.174803 (h:m:s)
[2021-11-04 16:44:03] MEAN LOSS: 80.01731942131745

This is waaaay faster! 0.17s vs 11.46, a 67x speed-up! 

## Logging
Logging is handled with the `logging` Python module:

- the **console** shows a concise and easy-to-read log;
- a **development logfile** stores the debug-level logs (typically named `gethurricaneloss_dev.log.x`);
- a **production logfile** stores a production-level (info and above) logs (typically named `gethurricaneloss.log.x`).

The numerical `.x` suffix (e.g., `.1`, `.2`, ...) in the log filenames allows for a rotating log file handling, for logs
of large volume.

## Testing
Testing uses `pytest` and is performed automatically with GitHub Actions on every push on any branch.

Note that GitHub Actions is free for an unlimited amount of compute-minutes for open source projects.

I implemented three tests, with a matrix of parametrizations:

| test name                          | test description                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| test_simulators_accuracy           | Test if the different simulators return mean losses that agree within a relative tolerance `rtol` and an absolute tolerance `atol`. |
| test_simulator_selection           | Test exceptions if the chosen simulator_id doesn't exist.    |
| test_input_parameter_values        | Test exceptions if input data has forbidden values.         |

All the three tests use `pytest.mark.parametrize`, which allows repeating the same test with different
input parameters, handy to test the validity of a test under different scenarios.

Additional tests that it would be easy to implement:

- a test against analytical expected values for the mean loss, considering that the expectation values for
  the Poissonian is the `mean` (i.e., `florida_landfall_rate`) and the expected values for the LogNormal is
  again the `mean` (i.e., `florida_mean`).

- a test to check the CLI usage from a shell (e.g., using `subprocess`).

- additional convergence checks.

## Accuracy checks
Accuracy is checked in the tests.

In particular, `test_simulators_consistency` checks that the 5 implementations of the hurricane loss model return mean loss
values within a given accuracy. To have relatively quick checks, the threshold accuracy is now set to 1%, but it can be
made smaller (i.e. tighter constraint), at the cost of longer CI tests.

## Performance checks
TBD
